The Strategy Design Pattern was chosen because:

Different Processing Logic for File Types: CSV, JSON, and XML require distinct ways to read, parse, and save data. The Strategy Pattern allows encapsulating this logic into separate, interchangeable classes.

Extensibility for New Formats: If a new file format (e.g., YAML) needs to be added, a new processor can be created without modifying the existing system, adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

Dynamic File Processing: The client (DataProcessor) can dynamically select the appropriate processor (e.g., CSVProcessor, JSONProcessor, or XMLProcessor) based on the file type.

Simplified Code Structure: Avoids complex if-else or switch statements in the main processing logic, keeping the system clean and maintainable.

Separation of Concerns: Each file format's processing is isolated in its own class, making the system modular and easier to debug or extend.

In short, the Strategy Pattern aligns perfectly with the scenario's need for flexible, extensible, and clean processing of different file formats.
